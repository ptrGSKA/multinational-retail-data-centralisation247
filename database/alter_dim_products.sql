#You will need to do some work on the products table before casting the data types correctly.
#The product_price column has a Â£ character which you need to remove using SQL.
#The team that handles the deliveries would like a new human-readable column added for the weight so they can quickly make decisions on delivery weights.
#Add a new column weight_class which will contain human-readable values based on the weight range of the product.
